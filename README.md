# Serialization Sandbox

A simple playground of different serialization types.

The objective of this repository is to provide a framework to choose different
serialization mechanisms suitable for Ethereum.

## SUITE (TODOS)

    * Basic structure serialization of default values
    * Basic structure serialization with maximum values
* [ ] Benchmark
    * Time taken to serialize/deserialize default values
    * Time taken to serialize/deserialize max values
    * Benchmark of serialize/deserialize read/write patterns.
* [ ] Profile of operations
    * CPU profiling
    * Memory profiling
